# Learning Objective-C

As an Android developer I find important to understand the world of iOS. It is a world I cannot ignore its existence. Knowing the basics of Objective-C and Swift are helpful ways to communicate with the iOS team, read code to look up api calls, webview interactions, and same third party libraries applied in both platforms.

Our work is always paired, so I find this kind of learning helpful.

To be honest, I thought Objective-C was harder than I thought it was. OOP fundamentals are there, and it's just a different syntax.

The whole learning experience is broken in branches. I did this during my free time within three weeks. [Objective-C Essential Training](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/objective-c-essential-training/inheritance-and-overriding-in-objective-c)
